            HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language
            for creating web pages. It provides the structure and content of a
            webpage, defining elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images,
            and more. HTML is not a programming language, but rather a markup
            language that uses tags and attributes to organize and present
            information on a webpage.

          <p>
            CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet
            language used for describing the presentation of a document written
            in a markup language, most commonly HTML. It is a fundamental
            technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

          <p>
            JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted
            programming language and a core technology of the World Wide Web. It
            is primarily used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web
            pages, working alongside HTML (for content structure) and CSS (for
            styling).

          <p>
            Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language known
            for its emphasis on code readability, achieved through the use of
            significant indentation. It is dynamically type-checked and
            garbage-collected.

          <p>
            MySQL is primarily used as a relational database management system
            (RDBMS). It's a system for storing, managing, and retrieving
            structured data, often used in web applications and other software
            that needs to store and access information. Its open-source nature,
            reliability, and scalability make it a popular choice for both small
            and large applications.
